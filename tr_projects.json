The Emergency Management Service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia will be the owner of the system. The system will allow collection and sharing of big volumes of data for modeling socio-economic vulnerability to natural hazards. It will be a valid source for hazard maps and risk profiles for various state agencies across all economic sectors.  ",

All disasters have the potential to cause disruption, damage property and take lives.

In some cases, such as a weather related or volcanic disaster, there may be time for a warning. But an earthquake or a tsunami close to land could strike without warning. All disasters have the potential to cause disruption, damage property and take lives. The portal offers information material on different hazards, as well as guidance on establishing a household emergency plan and creating an emergency survival kit. In addition, information for people with disabilities is being offered and emergency contact details are provided.",

By integrating Marlo into LINE, a chat messaging application popular among young people in Southeast Asia, users are able to ask any questions on HIV and get real time answers. By adding this chat bot in LINE, users can get interesting and relevant information about HIV and be rewarded by answering quizzes. Most importantly, users can book appointments to get tested for HIV with just a tap, as well as be connected to real-life counselors to get a reliable information about HIV.

It was one of the worst disasters to hit Vanuatu, destroying thousands of buildings and leaving around 75 000 people homeless. Relief efforts were quickly organized, with a strong need for assessment of the areas affected. Drones were felt to be an ideal solution for rapid and granular evaluation of the situation, particularly since cloud cover obscured satellite images",
