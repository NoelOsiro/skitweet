The messages shared as part of the #TabunginAja (#JustSaveIt) campaign, were informed by BeSci and included setting specific goals and applying rules of thumb to prompt the target behaviour (e.g. to encourage agents to ask their customers to save their shopping change if the amount is less than USD0.35).",

Pulse Lab Jakarta, in collaboration with the Government of Indonesia, developed  Haze Gazer, a crisis analysis tool that provides real-time situational information from various data sources to enhance disaster management efforts. The prototype uses advanced data analysis of sources including: satellite imagery, information on population density and distribution from government databases, citizen-generated data and real-time data from social media. The capability afforded by the tool can enhance disaster risk management efforts to protect vulnerable populations as well as the environment.",

Our DPPD team members from GIZ Ecuador are working with the Ecuadorian Ministry of Environment and Water to implement its national bioeconomy strategy for the protection and sustainable use of biodiversity by developing socially, economically, and ecologically sustainable solutions. Agricultural practices are one of the main causes of deforestation in the Ecuadorian Amazon. 99% of deforested areas are transformed into agricultural fields, and 64.9% of these are used as grassland for livestock.development challenges they face.",

The project solicits the latest technology from different fields: Remote Sensing to acquire Earth Observations (EO) data, Computer Vision to process these data and Machine Learning (ML) to develop models in order to relate meteorological and other EO data with flooding. The approach is deployed to address one of the most pressing problems B&H currently faces increasingly frequent occurrence of floods, and shall result in accurate models of rainfal runoff behavior's, which would help Water Agencies and the Federal Hydro Meteorological Institute with flood prediction and management.",

By integrating Marlo into LINE, a chat messaging application popular among young people in Southeast Asia, users are able to ask any questions on HIV and get real time answers. By adding this chat bot in LINE, users can get interesting and relevant information about HIV and be rewarded by answering quizzes. Most importantly, users can book appointments to get tested for HIV with just a tap, as well as be connected to real-life counselors to get a reliable information about HIV. Tanya Marlo was launched in Jakarta on 18 December 2018. ",

By using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to analyze images provided by satellites, WFP can respond to emergencies without the delays and logistics obstacles associated with a traditional response. Skai dramatically speeds up the process of determining what has happened, what to expect on the ground, and help define the kind of support that is required.  ",

However, in 2015 the amount of rainfall was 90 per cent above normal, attributed to the El Nio effect. It was the worst rainfall in 100 years, causing severe flooding, which was magnified as a result of sprawling urban development and inadequate drainage systems. It was estimated that more than 500 people died and 1.8 million people were displaced during the several weeks of flooding. Although emergency telephone numbers were established, they were overloaded, making it difficult to get through, making social media such as Facebook and Twitter a popular method for communication for those with Internet access.",

It also works to develop the broader ecosystem, helping ensure that the messaging service and content of each health programme is integrated and reinforces other health services. In doing so, each programme becomes a sustainable part of the health system whilst also helping to promote health and wellbeing around the world.",

In particular, because UAVs can collect information from the air, there has been much research into human search using UAVs equipped with cameras. However, the disadvantage of cameras is that they struggle to detect people who are hidden in shadows. To solve this problem, we mounted an array microphone on a UAV and to detect the human voice as a means of finding people that cameras cannot. Also a search method is proposed that combines voice and camera human detection to compensate for their respective shortcomings. The rate and accuracy of human detection by the proposed method are assessed experimentally.",

The last population census in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was carried out in 2002, leaving a major gap in population data. This gap can create serious problems during emergencies. For example, during a winter storm in 2012, rescue helicopters were dispatched to remote villages only to discover that nobody was there. Having real-time tools in place could help capture the population's mobility and ensure that those most-at risk are reached on time. UNDP and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Crisis Management Center have recently completed integrated risk and hazard assessments in each of the 81 municipalities in the country. Using mobile data to complement all this work seemed the natural next step. The way people use mobile phones provides insights into patterns of behaviour on the ground that can be life-saving. The team set out to study whether mobile phone calls could serve as proxy indicators for people's mobility, as well as to understand how men and women use mobile phones differently (for clues into their diverse levels of vulnerability based on sex-disaggregated data).",

        "title": "Quantifying Real-Time Rainfall Intensity in Bosnia and Herzegovina",
        "description": "Accurate, spatially dense real-time rainfall measurements are essential for water management of any region, which in turn impacts agriculture, transportation and mobility, energy and weather hazards. After the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, only 100 out of 500 rainfall stations have remained operational, hampering its spatial hydrological data collection. The project employs Big Data and Machine Learning, to fill in the missing gap by turning CCTV footage and videos obtained by smartphones into a real-time rainfall observation, allowing for accurately geo-referenced and cost-effective data collection. All the information collected is then available on the web portal and enable the authorities to be better prepared for meteorologically and hydrologically based hazards and associated risks for the population and to lead to a better-informed policymaking.",
